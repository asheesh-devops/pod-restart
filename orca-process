✅ What You Need to Do:
1. Create Missing Orca Projects (In Orca UI)
You already have:

✅ klearnow (development) - project key: development
✅ klearnow_stage (staging) - project key: staging

You need to create:

❌ QAT project - project key: qat
❌ Production project - project key: production

How to create them:

Go to Orca UI → AppSec Management → Projects
Click "Create New" button
Create QAT project:

Project Name: klearnow_qat (or whatever you prefer)
Project Key: qat (MUST be exactly "qat")


Create Production project:

Project Name: klearnow_prod (or whatever you prefer)
Project Key: production (MUST be exactly "production")



2. Update Your Jenkinsfile (In Your Git Repo)
Replace the entire stage('Docker') section in your Jenkinsfile with the optimized code I provided.

❌ What You DON'T Need to Do:

❌ No Jenkins configuration changes needed
❌ No new Jenkins credentials (you already have ORCA_API_TOKEN)
❌ No Jenkins plugins to install
❌ No environment variables to add


📋 Quick Checklist:
□ Create Orca project: klearnow_qat (project key: qat)
□ Create Orca project: klearnow_prod (project key: production)
□ Update Jenkinsfile with optimized Docker stage code
□ Commit and push changes to Git
□ Trigger builds on staging/qat/master branches
□ Check Orca UI for scan results (5-15 minutes after build)
That's it! The ORCA_API_TOKEN credential already exists in your Jenkins (you're using it for development scans), so everything else is ready to go. 🚀
